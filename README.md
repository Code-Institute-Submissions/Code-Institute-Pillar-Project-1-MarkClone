# Code Institute - Pillar Project #1 - Mark Clone inc.

Let's Face It! I did'nt quite make it all in time. Everyone can see that it is not finnished yet. Submiting it anyway for possible feedback.

## Project Summary
This project is educational as part of my Full-Stack Developer course at <a href="https://codeinstitute.net/" target="_blank">Code Institute</a>. It is the first out of four Pillar Projects to be completed in the course. This project #1 is limited to using html5, CSS3 and CSS-Frameworks such as Bootstrap. 

The project I have chosen to make is web-site for the very fictitious company Mark-Clone inc. The company is selling it's one and only (also very fictional) product; the fully modular clone of Mark (as a coincidence Mark happens to be my own name) The latest model is Mark-2000 - The ultimate Employee and Coworker.

### The Inspiration
The inspiration for this project originates mainly from the car industry where you can order a customized version of your car directly on the Company webpage. Where you first pick your basic model, and then add an engine alternative, gear-box, climate-control system, color, interior etc. Instead of a car I now try to sell an imaginary cloned version of myself. As you can see I approach this concept for content in a very lighthearted way (but I take the project very seriously indeed). Why not have some fun while learning? I hope you donâ€™t mind.
